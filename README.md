## What's Voyager?
Voyager is a brand-new conceptual operating system based on web.
## How should I use it?
#### 1. Clone the source code through git
   `git clone https://github.com/tuling-nextstep/voyager/`
#### 2. Reinstall electron and run the electron app  
   `yarn add electron` or `pnpm add electron`  
   We do not recommend you to use npm, because it is slower and harder to use than yarn and pnpm.
#### 3. Debug it
   `yarn start` or `pnpm start`
